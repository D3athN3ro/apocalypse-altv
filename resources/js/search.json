[[{"i":"what-is-rebar","l":"What is Rebar?","p":["Rebar is a plug-and-play base framework for the alternative GTA:V multiplayer client alt:V. Rebar is meant to act as a light framework that provides utility, and a basic standard for building plugins that can be compatible with other plugins.","It's a single resource game mode with the best features from the Athena Framework. It has a heavy focus on simplifying building game modes and lowering the friction of building a server."]},{"i":"why-rebar","l":"Why Rebar?","p":["Rebar is the foundational piece necessary to construct large concrete structures.

It still works as a decent starting point, but I've added too many features to the point where it lost its way during production.
