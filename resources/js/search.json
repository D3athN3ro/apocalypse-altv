Rebar is meant to act as a light framework that provides utility, and a basic standard for building plugins that can be compatible with other plugins.","It's a single resource game mode with the best features from the Athena Framework. It has a heavy focus on simplifying building game modes and lowering the friction of building a server."]},{"i":"why-rebar","l":"Why Rebar?","p":["Rebar is the foundational piece necessary to construct large concrete structures.

It still works as a decent starting point, but I've added too many features to the point where it lost its way during production. I wanted Athena to be a plugin-based framework, but users kept pushing for more and more.","With that being said, Rebar is an attempt to scavenge the good parts and leave behind the complexities."]},{"i":"backward-compatible-plugins","l":"Backward Compatible Plugins?","p":["No. Rebar will have a slightly different API that is similar to Vue Composables."]},{"l":"Tech Stack","p":["MongoDB","TypeScript","Vue"]}],[{"l":"Development","p":["When developing there are a handful of useful commands you can use in a terminal to help you build your server.","Let's talk about what some of those commands are."]},{"l":"Development Mode","p":["If you want to work on your code and automatically reconnect ensure you enable debug for your alt:V Client and then run the following in a terminal."]},{"l":"Webview Development Mode","p":["If you want to focus on your Webview development, you can use the following to open a local server to preview pages.","Note: Ensure you restart the server when you create new vue components or new pages."]},{"l":"Plugins","p":["Plugins should be your #1 way to build new features for your server.
